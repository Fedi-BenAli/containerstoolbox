Slide 1: Title
Title: Workload Isolation Strategy for OpenShift Cluster
Subtitle: "Predictable Maintenance Through Dedicated NodeGroups"
Your Name/Team + Date (01/06/2026)  

Slide 2: Current Challenges
Current Setup:
24 shared worker nodes across all users
Cross-team disruptions during maintenance
Unpredictable downtime for critical projects
Goals:
Isolate workloads by user/project groups
Enable targeted maintenance windows
Improve resource accountability

Slide 3: Proposed Solution (Key Visual)
Architecture Schematic:
6 NodeGroups (4 nodes each)
NodeGroups labeled CIA=<project>
Namespaces → NodeGroups via label selectors (visual arrows)
Tagline:
"One NodeGroup = One User Group = One Maintenance Window"

Slide 4: Technical Implementation (1/2)
Core Mechanisms:
NodeGroup creation (OpenShift MachineSets)
Taints/Tolerations for isolation
Node labels: nodegroup=<id>
Namespace affinity rules
Sample Configuration:
yaml
Copy
nodeSelector:
  nodegroup: "cia-projectx"
tolerations:
- key: "dedicated"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "cia-projectx"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
Slide 5: Technical Implementation (2/2)
Maintenance Workflow:
Notify affected NodeGroup users
Drain nodes: oc adm drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets
Perform maintenance (upgrades, reboots)
Verify pod rescheduling
Reactivate nodes
Benefits:
75% smaller blast radius during maintenance
Zero impact on unrelated NodeGroups
Slide 6: User Impact
New Requirements:
Add CIA label to namespaces:
bash
Copy
oc label namespace my-project CIA=projectx
Monitor NodeGroup-specific quotas
Unchanged Elements:
Access to cluster-wide resources (storage, networking)
Existing CI/CD pipelines
Slide 7: Rollout Plan
Phase 1 (Month 1):
Create NodeGroups + monitoring dashboards
Phase 2 (Month 2):
Migrate high-priority projects (voluntary)
Phase 3 (Month 3):
Enforce taints/tolerations
Phase 4 (Month 4):
Mandatory node affinity policies
Slide 8: Anticipated FAQs
Q: What if a NodeGroup runs out of capacity?
A: Automatic alerts + option to scale horizontally  

Q: How to handle cross-project dependencies?
A: Use shared NodeGroups with shared=true label  

Q: Cost tracking?
A: Monthly reports per NodeGroup + budget alerts  

Slide 9: Next Steps
Security review of isolation model
Documentation portal creation
Hands-on workshops for users
Standardized project templates
Slide 10: Conclusion
Key Benefits:
🛠️ Granular maintenance control
📈 Improved resource forecasting
🔒 Enhanced stability for critical workloads
