Presentation Title: OpenShift Infrastructure Optimization: Segmentation by NodeGroups
Subtitle: Targeted Maintenance Strategy and Workload Isolation

Slide 1: Introduction and Current Context
Title: Our OpenShift Environment Today
Content:
Infrastructure: A robust single cluster consisting of 24 Worker Nodes.
Current Situation: Workloads (Pods) are distributed randomly across all 24 nodes.
The Challenge:
Maintenance (updates, reboots) potentially impacts everyone unpredictably.
Lack of visibility on "who is running where."
"Noisy Neighbor" risk (one application consuming all resources impacts others).

Slide 2: The New Strategy: NodeGroups
Title: Segmentation into NodeGroups
Suggested Visual: A diagram showing the 24-node cluster divided into 6 distinct blocks of 4 nodes each.
Content:
The Concept: Dividing our large cluster into logical and physical subsets called "NodeGroups."
Sizing:
Total Worker Nodes: 24
NodeGroup Size: 4 Worker Nodes
Total Capacity: 6 distinct NodeGroups.
Immediate Benefit: Creating dedicated availability zones within the same cluster.

Slide 3: Assignment Mechanism (The CIA Label)
Title: How Will You Be Assigned?
Suggested Visual: An arrow connecting a User Namespace to a NodeGroup via a tag/label.
Content:
The Unique Identifier: Usage of the label CIA=[Project_Name].
The Rule: All namespaces (dev, test, prod environments) sharing the same CIA will be automatically directed to the same NodeGroup.
Technique: Using OpenShift NodeSelectors and Taints/Tolerations to ensure your applications stay on your dedicated nodes.

Slide 4: Benefits for Users ("The Why")
Title: What's In It For You?
Content:
1. Predictable Maintenance:
We only update one NodeGroup at a time.
If your project is on NodeGroup A, maintenance on NodeGroup B does not affect you.
Possibility to negotiate maintenance windows specific to your NodeGroup.
2. Performance Isolation:
Your resources (CPU/RAM) are guaranteed within your group.
Load spikes from another project (different CIA) will not impact your applications.
3. Increased Stability: Reduced blast radius in case of hardware incidents.

Slide 5: Maintenance Scenario (Comparison)
Title: Managing Service Downtime
Comparison Table:
Before (Flat Cluster):
Cluster update = Risk of Pod restarts at any time.
Coordination required with all users for even minor interventions.
After (NodeGroups):
Maintenance of NodeGroup 1 (Project Alpha) on Monday night.
Maintenance of NodeGroup 2 (Project Beta) on Saturday morning.
Result: You choose the slot that impacts your business activity the least.

Slide 6: Impacts and Prerequisites
Title: What Changes for Your Deployments
Content:
Transparency: For developers, interaction with the OpenShift API remains the same.
Configuration:
We (the Ops team) will apply the Project (Namespace) configurations for you.
Your deployment files (YAML/Helm) generally do not need modification, unless you have specific hardcoded constraints.
Capacity: Each project is limited to the power of 4 nodes (sufficient for High Availability), encouraging better resource management.

Slide 7: Roadmap and Next Steps
Title: Migration Schedule
Content:
Phase 1: Creation and labeling of NodeGroups (No impact).
Phase 2: Pilot migration (First volunteer project).
Phase 3: Progressive migration of other CIAs (Project by Project).
Key Dates: [Insert your estimated dates here].

Slide 8: Q&A
Title: Thank You
Content:
Open floor for discussion.
